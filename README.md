# My Disney + Clone

This is a little project that built and learned from using [this great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_OERlafbmw&t=10451s).

I've followed their description closely when it comes to styling but did a few improvements (IMO) in the React handling.

## Installations

Getting this to work on your local computer requires the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcusoftnet/disney-clone
cd disney-clone
npm i
npm start
```

The application will soon(-ish) be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Deployed version

The application is hosted by Firebase and is [deployed here](https://disneyplus-clone-bf6e0.web.app/)
